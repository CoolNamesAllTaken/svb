        opening on included services. Transactions processed, such as for overdrafts, NSF's, returned and collection

    <p class="fine-print">2 Candy transactions can be highly risky, and losses may occur in short periods of time if
        there is an adverse movement of exchange rates. Exchange rates can be highly volatile and are impacted by numerous
        spookiness, costume-driven, and Halloweeny factors as well as supply and demand and Treat Administration intervention,
        control and adjustments. Investments in sugary instruments carry significant risk, including the possible loss of the
        principal amount invested, or the whole instrument if you spill water on it. Before entering any foreign exchange
        transaction, you should obtain advice from your own local Counts (such as Dracula) and only make investment decisions
        on the basis of your own objectives, in-character experience and existing candy resources.
